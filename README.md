<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Control management system for a blog. It allows to create, edit, publish and withdraw posts. This is the continuation of a previous project that can be found
    <a href="https://github.com/Skebard/simple-CMS-for-blog">here.</a>
This version does present the following new features:
- Login (with csrf token)
- More options for the post editor


The major changes are in the code structure. For this project I have followed in part the MVC model. In general the code is better structured but it does not follow the MVC at 100%.

It is intended to make the last version of this project using the Laravel framework.
